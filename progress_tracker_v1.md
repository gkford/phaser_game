# Prehistoric Technology Game - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Introduce the New Schema
- [ ] Define new Task interface
- [ ] Expand GameState to use tasks Record
- [ ] Convert core tasks to new format:
  - [ ] foodGathering
  - [ ] thinkingL1 
  - [ ] hunting
- [ ] Initialize population.unassigned
- [ ] Test basic state initialization

## Phase 2: Migrate Assignments & Resource Calculations
- [ ] Remove old population role fields
- [ ] Update reassignWorker function
- [ ] Rewrite calculateFoodRate
- [ ] Rewrite calculateThoughtRate
- [ ] Implement emergency food logic
- [ ] Test worker reassignment
- [ ] Test resource calculations

## Phase 3: Migrate Research to Per-Task Progress
- [ ] Remove old researchProgress
- [ ] Add currentResearchTaskId
- [ ] Implement thought distribution logic
- [ ] Add state transition logic:
  - [ ] Unthoughtof → Imagined
  - [ ] Imagined → Discovered
- [ ] Test research progression
- [ ] Test state transitions

## Phase 4: Clean-Up and Extension
- [ ] Remove redundant logic
- [ ] Add state validation tests:
  - [ ] Task assignment sums
  - [ ] Research transitions
  - [ ] Resource calculations
- [ ] Document new structure
- [ ] Prepare for future extensions:
  - [ ] Additional resources
  - [ ] New task types
  - [ ] Enhanced prerequisites

## Current Status
- Phase 1: Not Started
- Phase 2: Not Started
