# Game Plan Implementation Progress

## Phase 0: Foundation ‚úÖ

- [x] Create GameState interface with:
  - food
  - population (total, hunting, thinking, unassigned)
- [x] Initialize state manager with default values
- [x] Basic validation (total never exceeds 10)
- [x] Set up core game loop using Phaser's clock:
  - [x] 1-second interval timer
  - [x] Basic update callback (currently logging)

## Phase 1: Core Systems üöß

- [x] Implement rate calculations:
  - [x] calculateFoodRate(state) ‚Üí net food/sec
    - [x] Each hunter produces 2 food/sec
    - [x] Each person consumes 1 food/sec
  - [x] calculateThoughtRate(state) ‚Üí thoughts/sec
    - [x] Each thinker produces 1 thought/sec
- [x] Build state transition system:
  - [x] reassignWorker(fromActivity, toActivity)
  - [x] Emergency reset function (allToHunting())
  - [x] Validate transitions maintain population constraints
- [x] Create basic debug UI:
  - [x] Text labels showing raw state values
    - [x] Current food storage
    - [x] Net food per second
    - [x] Current thoughts per second
    - [x] Total population
  - [x] Rate displays (+3 food/sec style)

## Phase 2: UI & Interaction ‚è≥

- [x] Build activity cards with:
  - [x] Assignment count displays
  - [x] +/- buttons (needs handler implementation)
  - [x] Net contribution labels
- [x] Implement button handlers
- [x] Create emergency detection system

## Phase 3: Emergency System ‚úÖ

- [x] Create popup overlay
- [x] Implement state restrictions
- [x] Emergency exit condition handling
- [x] Add game pause during emergency
- [x] Resume game after acknowledgment

## Phase 4: Polishing ‚è≥

- [x] Smooth animations
- [x] Immediate UI updates for button interactions
- [ ] Audio feedback
- [ ] Final validation

## Notes
- Phase 0 completed with validation system in place
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
- Current focus should be on rate calculations and state transitions
