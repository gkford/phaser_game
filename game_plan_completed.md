# Game Plan Implementation Progress

## Phase 0: Foundation ‚úÖ

- [x] Create GameState interface with:
  - food
  - population (total, hunting, thinking, unassigned)
- [x] Initialize state manager with default values
- [x] Basic validation (total never exceeds 10)
- [x] Set up core game loop using Phaser's clock:
  - [x] 1-second interval timer
  - [x] Basic update callback (currently logging)

## Phase 1: Core Systems üöß

- [x] Implement rate calculations:
  - [x] calculateFoodRate(state) ‚Üí net food/sec
    - [x] Each hunter produces 2 food/sec
    - [x] Each person consumes 1 food/sec
  - [x] calculateThoughtRate(state) ‚Üí thoughts/sec
    - [x] Each thinker produces 1 thought/sec
- [x] Build state transition system:
  - [x] reassignWorker(fromActivity, toActivity)
  - [x] Emergency reset function (allToHunting())
  - [x] Validate transitions maintain population constraints
- [ ] Create basic debug UI:
  - [ ] Text labels showing raw state values
    - [ ] Current food storage
    - [ ] Net food per second
    - [ ] Current thoughts per second
    - [ ] Total population
  - [ ] Rate displays (+3 food/sec style)

## Phase 2: UI & Interaction ‚è≥

- [ ] Build activity cards with:
  - [ ] Assignment count displays
  - [ ] +/- buttons (disabled when unavailable)
  - [ ] Net contribution labels
- [ ] Implement button handlers
- [ ] Create emergency detection system

## Phase 3: Emergency System ‚è≥

- [ ] Create popup overlay
- [ ] Implement state restrictions
- [ ] Emergency exit condition handling

## Phase 4: Polishing ‚è≥

- [ ] Smooth animations
- [ ] Audio feedback
- [ ] Final validation

## Notes
- Phase 0 completed with validation system in place
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
- Current focus should be on rate calculations and state transitions
