# Prehistoric Technology Game - V1 Specification

## Game Overview
A tech tree progression game where players manage basic resources to unlock advanced tasks through thought generation. Features card state transitions (Unthoughtof ‚Üí Imagined ‚Üí Discovered) based on meeting prerequisites.

## Core Game State

### Resources
1. **Food**
   - Stored resource (accumulates/depletes)
   - If humans are gathering food, hunting or doing another task like that, they produce food according to the properties of that task.
   - Whether humans are gathring food or not, they are always consuming food at 1 per second
   
2. **Thoughts Level 1**
   - Rate-based resource (not stored)
   - Generated by Thinking tasks - intitally this is just thikning Level 1, but more will become available.
   - Humans must be assigned to a thinking task in order to contribute to the thinking rate.

### Human Units
- **Human Level 1**
  - Fixed population: 10 units
  - Consumption: 1 food/second
  - Can be assigned to tasks. Intially there are only two tasks they can be assigned to
    1. Food Gathering 
    2. Thinking Level 1 

Both food gathering snd thinking have the initial state of "discovered" which means, in their case because they are a task, that they can ahve humans assigned to them

### Task States
1. **Unthoughtof**  
   - Hidden mechanics ("????" display)
   - Greyed out
   - There is a button "imagine" and a progress bar. 
2. **Imagined**  
   - yellow border
   - Visible requirements/stats
   - Think About This button, which means that any thinking being produced is applied to the progress bar for this task. Only one unthoughtof or imagined task can have "imagine" or "Think about this" selected at any one time. So If you toggle one on, all the others toggle off. 
   - Contains a progress bar showing progress towards being discovered
   - Tasks need a property for the amount of thinking that needs to be accumulated by them until they can be discovered
3. **Discovered**  
   - Full interaction enabled
   - green border

## Resource Mechanics

### Per-Second Calculations
1. **Food**  
   `(Food Gathering Humans √ó 1.2) + (Hunting Humans √ó 2) - Total Population`
   
2. **Thoughts**  
   `Thinking Humans √ó 1`

### Emergency Protocol
When food reaches 0:
1. Red warning popup appears
2. Auto-reassign all humans to Food Gathering
3. Disable Thinking tasks until food >0
4. Persistent warning until net food becomes positive

### Research Process
1. Meet prerequisites ‚Üí State becomes Imagined
2. Click "Think About This" ‚Üí Progress bar appears
3. Complete research ‚Üí State becomes Discovered
4. Enables new assignment controls

## User Interface

### Left Panel (Resources)
```
Food Storage: x

Food Rates:
 Production: +x/sec
 Consumption: -x/sec
 Net Rate: +x/sec

Thought Rate: x/sec

Population:
 Total: x
 Hunting: x
 Thinking: x
 Unassigned: x
```

### Right Panel (Task Cards)
**Food Gathering Card (Discovered)**
```
[üçñ] Food Gathering
Humans Assigned: 8
Food production: 1.2/human/second
[ - ][ + ]
```

**Thinking L1 Card (Discovered)**
```
[ü§î] Thinking Level 1
Humans Assigned: 2
Thoughts Production: +1/human/second
[ - ][ + ]
```

**Hunting Card (Unthoughtof)**
```
[????]
```

### Card Visual Hierarchy
1. **Icons**: Emoji (top-left)
2. **Title**: Bold header
3. **Status**:
   - Unthoughtof: Greyed-out background
   - Imagined: Yellow "Available to Research" glow
   - Discovered: Color-coded border
4. **Controls**:
   - Imagined: Research button + progress bar
   - Discovered: Assignment buttons

## Game Logic

### Assignment Rules
1. Humans can only be reassigned from Discovered tasks
2. Thinking tasks auto-unassign during food emergencies
3. Hunting requires completed research before assignments
