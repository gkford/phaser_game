# Prehistoric Technology Game - V1 Specification

## Game Overview
A tech tree progression game where players manage basic resources to unlock advanced tasks through thought generation. Features card state transitions (Unthoughtof → Imagined → Discovered) based on meeting prerequisites.

## Core Game State

### Resources
1. **Food**
   - Stored resource (accumulates/depletes)
   - Base rate: +0.2 per Food Gathering worker (1.2 produced - 1 consumed)
   
2. **Thoughts Level 1**
   - Rate-based resource (not stored)
   - Generated by Thinking tasks

### Human Units
- **Human Level 1**
  - Fixed population: 10 units
  - Consumption: 1 food/second
  - Can be assigned to 3 task types:
    1. Food Gathering (Discovered)
    2. Thinking Level 1 (Imagined)
    3. Hunting (Unthoughtof)

### Task States
1. **Unthoughtof**  
   - Hidden mechanics ("????" display)
   - Greyed out with no interaction
2. **Imagined**  
   - Visible requirements/stats
   - "Think About This" research button
3. **Discovered**  
   - Full interaction enabled
   - Color-coded border by type

## Resource Mechanics

### Per-Second Calculations
1. **Food**  
   `(Food Gathering Workers × 1.2) + (Hunting Workers × 2) - Total Population`
   
2. **Thoughts**  
   `Thinking Workers × 1`

### Emergency Protocol
When food reaches 0:
1. Red warning popup appears
2. Auto-reassign all humans to Food Gathering
3. Disable Thinking tasks until food >0
4. Persistent warning until net food becomes positive

## Tech Progression System

### Task Requirements
| Task            | Prerequisites               | Initial State |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Food Gathering  | None                       | Discovered    |
| Thinking Level 1| Food >0                    | Imagined      |
| Hunting         | 1 Thought/sec + Thinking L1| Unthoughtof   |

### Research Process
1. Meet prerequisites → State becomes Imagined
2. Click "Think About This" → Progress bar appears
3. Complete research → State becomes Discovered
4. Enables new assignment controls

## User Interface

### Left Panel (Resources)
```
Food Storage: x

Food Rates:
 Production: +x/sec
 Consumption: -x/sec
 Net Rate: +x/sec

Thought Rate: x/sec

Population:
 Total: x
 Hunting: x
 Thinking: x
 Unassigned: x
```

### Right Panel (Task Cards)
**Food Gathering Card (Discovered)**
```
[🍖] Food Gathering
Humans Assigned: 8
Net Food: +0.2/human
[ - ][ + ]
```

**Thinking L1 Card (Discovered)**
```
[🤔] Thinking Level 1
Humans Assigned: 2
Thoughts: +1/human
[ - ][ + ]
```

**Hunting Card (Unthoughtof)**
```
[????]
```

### Card Visual Hierarchy
1. **Icons**: Emoji (top-left)
2. **Title**: Bold header
3. **Status**:
   - Unthoughtof: Greyed-out background
   - Imagined: Yellow "Available to Research" glow
   - Discovered: Color-coded border
4. **Controls**:
   - Imagined: Research button + progress bar
   - Discovered: Assignment buttons

## Game Logic

### Assignment Rules
1. Humans can only be reassigned from Discovered tasks
2. Thinking tasks auto-unassign during food emergencies
3. Hunting requires completed research before assignments

### Tech Unlock Flow
1. Maintain 1 Thought/sec for 60 seconds → Hunting becomes Imagined
2. Research Hunting (30s) → Enables 2 food/human efficiency
3. Assign hunters → Enables population growth potential

### State Transitions

  C -->|New Prerequisites Met| D[Higher-Level Task]
```

### Balance Considerations
- Base food surplus: +0.2/human (requires 83% population in Food Gathering for stability)
- Full Thinking assignment creates -8 food/sec deficit
- Hunting research unlocks sustainability (2 food/human)
